# DeepPCB_Project
DeepPCB is a deep learning project for detecting and classifying defects in PCB images. It uses CNNs for multi-label classification and object detection, identifying defects like open circuits, shorts, and pin-holes. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using standard metrics.
